\title{Construct the linkage map for a sequence of markers}
\usage{
map(
  input.seq,
  tol = 1e-04,
  verbose = FALSE,
  rm_unlinked = FALSE,
  phase_cores = 1
)
}
\arguments{
\item{input.seq}{an object of class \code{sequence}.}

\item{tol}{tolerance for the C routine, i.e., the value used to evaluate
convergence.}

\item{verbose}{If \code{TRUE}, print tracing information.}

\item{rm_unlinked}{When some pair of markers do not follow the linkage criteria, 
if \code{TRUE} one of the markers is removed and returns a vector with remaining 
marker numbers (useful for mds_onemap and map_avoid_unlinked functions).}

\item{phase_cores}{number of computer cores to be used in analysis}
}
\value{
An object of class \code{sequence}, which is a list containing the
following components: \item{seq.num}{a \code{vector} containing the
(ordered) indices of markers in the sequence, according to the input file.}
\item{seq.phases}{a \code{vector} with the linkage phases between markers
in the sequence, in corresponding positions. \code{-1} means that there are
no defined linkage phases.} \item{seq.rf}{a \code{vector} with the
recombination frequencies between markers in the sequence. \code{-1} means
that there are no estimated recombination frequencies.}
\item{seq.like}{log-likelihood of the corresponding linkage map.}
\item{data.name}{name of the object of class \code{onemap} with the raw
data.} \item{twopt}{name of the object of class \code{rf_2pts} with the
2-point analyses.}
}
\description{
Estimates the multipoint log-likelihood, linkage phases and recombination
frequencies for a sequence of markers in a given order.
}
\details{
Markers are mapped in the order defined in the object \code{input.seq}. If
this object also contains a user-defined combination of linkage phases,
recombination frequencies and log-likelihood are estimated for that
particular case. Otherwise, the best linkage phase combination is also
estimated. The multipoint likelihood is calculated according to Wu et al.
(2002b)(Eqs. 7a to 11), assuming that the recombination fraction is the
same in both parents. Hidden Markov chain codes adapted from Broman et al.
(2008) were used.
