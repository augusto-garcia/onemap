\usage{
seriation(input.seq, LOD = 0, max.rf = 0.5, tol = 1e-04)
}
\arguments{
\item{input.seq}{an object of class \code{sequence}.}

\item{LOD}{minimum LOD-Score threshold used when constructing the pairwise
recombination fraction matrix.}

\item{max.rf}{maximum recombination fraction threshold used as the LOD
value above.}

\item{tol}{tolerance for the C routine, i.e., the value used to evaluate
convergence.}
}
\value{
An object of class \code{sequence}, which is a list containing the
following components: \item{seq.num}{a \code{vector} containing the
(ordered) indices of markers in the sequence, according to the input file.}
\item{seq.phases}{a \code{vector} with the linkage phases between markers
in the sequence, in corresponding positions. \code{-1} means that there are
no defined linkage phases.} \item{seq.rf}{a \code{vector} with the
recombination frequencies between markers in the sequence. \code{-1} means
that there are no estimated recombination frequencies.}
\item{seq.like}{log-likelihood of the corresponding linkage map.}
\item{data.name}{name of the object of class \code{onemap} with the raw
data.} \item{twopt}{name of the object of class \code{rf.2pts} with the
2-point analyses.}
}
\description{
Implements the marker ordering algorithm \emph{Seriation} (\cite{Buetow &
Chakravarti, 1987}).
}
\details{
\emph{Seriation} is an algorithm for marker ordering in linkage groups. It
is not an exhaustive search method and, therefore, is not computationally
intensive. However, it does not guarantee that the best order is always
found. The only requirement is a matrix with recombination fractions
between markers.

NOTE: When there are to many pairs of markers with the same value in the
recombination fraction matrix, it can result in ties during the ordination
process and the \emph{Seriation} algorithm may not work properly. This is
particularly relevant for outcrossing populations with mixture of markers
of type \code{D1} and \code{D2}. When this occurs, the function shows the
following error message: \code{There are too many ties in the ordination
process - please, consider using another ordering algorithm}.

After determining the order with \emph{Seriation}, the final map is
constructed using the multipoint approach (function
\code{\link[onemap]{map}}).
