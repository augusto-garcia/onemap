  tol = 1e-05
)
}
\arguments{
\item{input.seq}{object of class sequence}

\item{size}{The center size around which an optimum is to be searched}

\item{overlap}{The desired overlap between batches}

\item{phase_cores}{The number of parallel processes to use when estimating
the phase of a marker. (Should be no more than 4)}

\item{tol}{tolerance for the C routine, i.e., the value used to evaluate
convergence.}
